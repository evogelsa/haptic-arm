# Haptic Arm

While working as an undergraduate researcher in the Roth Lab, I designed a
low cost haptic device. The devices utilizes a
[SCARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA) design with two revolute joints.
Each joint is actuated through timing belts via motors mounted on the base of
the arm.
