# TO DO

## Vector Fields

1. Correct vector fields
    - Circlebound goes outwards only
    - Spiralbound relies on circle bound
    - Verify spring
    - Add vector field that has deadband on outer parts of field

## Main

- After vector fields corrected verify hardware device aligns with visualization
